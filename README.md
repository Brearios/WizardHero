# WizardHero
My first Gamemaker project, where I began to learn to program

Run the game from the build directory. To look at code (GML, or Gamemaker Language), check the Scripts folder, as well as the Objects folder, where each Object will have a Create and Step file (similar to start and update in C#).

The game was inspired by World War Z, where a flock of humans is running from a zombie herd - what if there had been a frost mage there? Could she save the day?
